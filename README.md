# MachineLearning-Fake-News-Prediction
In these project we are given with different news along with their heading author and the main text and indicator whether these news are fake or not(1 for fake news 0 for not a fake news). Here our target is to build up a machine learning model that will tell us whether a news is fake Or not based on the title name and the author name of the news.
